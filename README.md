# AI-Powered-Chatbot-using-Supabase
create an AI-powered chatbot that can intelligently answer questions using data from our Supabase database. The ideal candidate will have experience in natural language processing and familiarity with Supabase integration. The chatbot will need to understand user queries and retrieve relevant information seamlessly. 
===================
To create an AI-powered chatbot that intelligently answers questions using data from your Supabase database, you'll need to follow these steps:

    Set up the Supabase database: First, ensure that your Supabase database is up and running. You should have an API key to access your Supabase instance and a table with relevant data.

    Integrate Supabase with Python: You'll use the supabase package to interact with your Supabase database. This will allow the chatbot to query the database based on user input.

    Natural Language Processing (NLP): You'll need to process the user’s input (text) to determine what they are asking and then map that to a relevant database query. A pre-trained model like GPT-3 from OpenAI or a custom model using NLP techniques can be used for this.

    Set up the chatbot: You'll create an interface where the user can input a query, and the chatbot will respond using data from Supabase.

Below is the Python code to create an AI-powered chatbot using Supabase and OpenAI GPT-3 for intelligent answering.
Prerequisites:

    Supabase account and API key (for accessing your database).
    OpenAI API key (for utilizing GPT-3 or another model for NLP).
    Python libraries: openai, supabase, flask (for chatbot web interface), and dotenv for storing sensitive keys.

Installation:

Install the necessary libraries using pip:

pip install openai supabase flask python-dotenv

1. Set Up .env File:

To keep your credentials secure, store them in a .env file. Here's an example:

SUPABASE_URL="your_supabase_url"
SUPABASE_KEY="your_supabase_key"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"

2. Python Code:

import openai
from supabase import create_client, Client
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Initialize Supabase client
SUPABASE_URL = os.getenv("SUPABASE_URL")
SUPABASE_KEY = os.getenv("SUPABASE_KEY")
supabase: Client = create_client(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY)

# Initialize OpenAI client
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Initialize Flask application
app = Flask(__name__)

# Function to query Supabase
def query_supabase(query):
    """
    Function to query the Supabase database based on user input.
    This will look for relevant data in your Supabase tables.
    """
    try:
        response = supabase.table("your_table_name").select("*").ilike("column_name", f"%{query}%").execute()
        return response.data
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error querying Supabase: {e}")
        return []

# Function to get AI response from OpenAI
def get_ai_response(query):
    """
    Function to generate a response using OpenAI GPT-3.
    This will take the user query and generate an answer.
    """
    try:
        response = openai.Completion.create(
            engine="text-davinci-003",  # You can use different engines
            prompt=f"Answer the following question based on the data: {query}",
            max_tokens=150
        )
        return response.choices[0].text.strip()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error generating response: {e}")
        return "Sorry, I couldn't process your request."

# Flask route to handle user queries
@app.route('/ask', methods=['POST'])
def ask():
    # Get the user query from the request
    user_query = request.json.get("query")

    if not user_query:
        return jsonify({"error": "Query is required"}), 400

    # First, try to query Supabase with the user's query
    supabase_data = query_supabase(user_query)
    
    # If data is found in Supabase, return that data
    if supabase_data:
        return jsonify({"answer": supabase_data}), 200

    # If no relevant data found, use AI to generate a response
    ai_response = get_ai_response(user_query)
    
    return jsonify({"answer": ai_response}), 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Explanation of Code:

    Environment Variables:
        The Supabase URL, Supabase key, and OpenAI API key are loaded from .env using the dotenv package to keep credentials secure.

    Supabase Client:
        The supabase.create_client function is used to create a connection to the Supabase database.
        The query_supabase function queries your Supabase database. It performs a case-insensitive search using ilike to find records in your table that match the user’s query.

    OpenAI GPT-3 Integration:
        The get_ai_response function generates a response using OpenAI’s GPT-3 model.
        It sends the user query as a prompt to the model and gets the generated answer.

    Flask API:
        The chatbot API is set up using Flask, with a POST route /ask where users can send queries.
        The chatbot first tries to search for relevant data in the Supabase database. If found, it returns that data.
        If no relevant data is found, it uses GPT-3 to generate a response and sends that as the answer.

3. Running the Chatbot:

To start the chatbot server locally, run:

python app.py

This will start a Flask server. You can now query the chatbot via HTTP requests.
Example Request (POST):

{
  "query": "What is the price of the laptop?"
}

Example Response (JSON):

{
  "answer": "The laptop costs $1500."
}

4. Testing the System:

You can test the chatbot using a tool like Postman or curl by sending POST requests to http://localhost:5000/ask with a JSON body containing the query.

For example:

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/ask -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "What is the price of the laptop?"}'

5. Expanding the Solution:

    Improved Query Processing: You can use advanced NLP models to better process and understand more complex user queries.
    User-Specific Responses: Add authentication to handle user-specific queries and personalize responses.
    Database Structure: Depending on your Supabase schema, modify the query_supabase function to adjust for different data structures (tables, columns, etc.).

By following these steps, you can create an AI-powered chatbot that intelligently answers questions based on data from your Supabase database, providing seamless and accurate responses.
